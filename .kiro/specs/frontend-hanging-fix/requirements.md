# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend application intermittently hangs and becomes unresponsive across different browsers, with no error logs appearing when the hanging occurs. This creates a poor user experience where the application sometimes works fine and other times becomes completely unresponsive. The issue appears to be related to network requests, proxy configuration, or resource loading problems that cause the React application to freeze without proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend application to always remain responsive, so that I can interact with the chat interface without experiencing hanging or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the application SHALL respond to user interactions within 2 seconds
2. WHEN network requests fail or timeout THEN the application SHALL display appropriate error messages instead of hanging
3. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL show a connection error message and remain interactive
4. WHEN API requests take longer than expected THEN the application SHALL show loading indicators and allow cancellation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display "Connection problem - please check your internet connection"
2. WHEN the backend server is down THEN the system SHALL display "Server unavailable - please try again later"
3. WHEN requests timeout THEN the system SHALL display "Request timed out - please try again"
4. WHEN proxy errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of frontend issues, so that I can quickly identify and fix problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL log request details, response status, and timing information
3. WHEN the application hangs THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic tools to identify the root cause
4. WHEN proxy issues occur THEN the system SHALL log proxy request/response details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to gracefully handle slow or failed network requests, so that the interface remains usable even when connectivity is poor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests exceed 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically cancel the request and show a timeout message
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide a retry mechanism
3. WHEN the backend is slow to respond THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
4. WHEN multiple requests are pending THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate requests and manage request queuing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to work reliably during message sending, so that my conversations are not interrupted by hanging or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending a message THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback within 100ms
2. WHEN message sending fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the message content and offer retry options
3. WHEN the backend is processing a message THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN message requests timeout THEN the system SHALL allow the user to resend without losing their input
