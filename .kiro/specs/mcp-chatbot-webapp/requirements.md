# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a full-stack chatbot web application with a JavaScript frontend and Python backend. The application will enable users to interact with an AI chatbot that can leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to provide enhanced responses with access to external tools and data sources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a chatbot through a web interface, so that I can ask questions and receive intelligent responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the web application THEN the system SHALL display a chat interface with an input field and message history
2. WHEN a user types a message and submits it THEN the system SHALL display the message in the chat history and send it to the backend
3. WHEN the backend processes a user message THEN the system SHALL display the chatbot's response in the chat history
4. WHEN the chat history becomes long THEN the system SHALL maintain scrollable message history with proper formatting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to provide intelligent responses, so that I can get helpful information and assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the backend SHALL process the message using an AI language model
2. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL return the response to the frontend within a reasonable time
3. WHEN an error occurs during AI processing THEN the system SHALL provide a user-friendly error message
4. WHEN the AI response is generated THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context for follow-up questions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure MCP servers for the chatbot, so that the bot can access external tools and data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN the system SHALL be able to connect to and communicate with them
2. WHEN the chatbot needs external information THEN the system SHALL query appropriate MCP servers for relevant data
3. WHEN MCP server calls are made THEN the system SHALL handle authentication and error responses appropriately
4. WHEN MCP servers are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality and inform users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chatbot to use external tools when needed, so that I can get more comprehensive and up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's question requires external data THEN the chatbot SHALL automatically determine which MCP tools to use
2. WHEN MCP tools are invoked THEN the system SHALL integrate the results seamlessly into the chatbot's response
3. WHEN multiple MCP tools are needed THEN the system SHALL coordinate their usage efficiently
4. WHEN MCP tool results are received THEN the system SHALL present them in a user-friendly format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean separation between frontend and backend, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs data THEN it SHALL communicate with the backend through a well-defined REST API
2. WHEN the backend processes requests THEN it SHALL return structured JSON responses
3. WHEN either frontend or backend is updated THEN the other component SHALL continue to function without modification
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the frontend and backend SHALL be able to run on separate servers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and user-friendly, so that I can use it effectively on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on different screen sizes THEN the interface SHALL adapt appropriately
2. WHEN a user is waiting for a response THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
3. WHEN messages are displayed THEN they SHALL be clearly formatted and easy to read
4. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN it SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
